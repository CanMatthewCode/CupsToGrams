CupsToGrams is an offline recipe conversion app which allows you to convert your
recipes from standard cups/tablespoons/teaspoon measurements into a weight-based 
recipe for overall ease of use.  Rather than trying to guess exactly how compact 1/4 
cup of brown sugar is, just tare your scale and weigh out your ingredients. 

Convert entire recipes, save them neatly to PDF, or simply check one ingredient at
a time quickly and easily. Taken from textbooks, manufacturers data sets, and my own 
weighing of ingredients over and over to get a proper average, CupsToGrams allows 
you to avoid the internet and hallucinating AI altogether as you cook.

Can’t find your needed ingredient out of the over 500 provided? Simply add it yourself to the 
appropriate ingredient type, or if you don’t like the amount given, modify it within the app.  

This converter also comes loaded with tons of my favorite recipes, including the best
chocolate chip cookie you’ll ever find. 

Simply download the repo, make your way to your chosen directory on the command line,
and type in make. The app should be available on all platforms (and if it’s not, please let me know).
