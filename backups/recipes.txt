Pulse 6 oz extra-sharp yellow cheddar, coarsley grated, fine-grind cornmeal,
		sugar, finely chopped sage, baking powder, salt, and all-purpose flour
		in a food processor a couple times to combine.

Add 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, and pulse
		a few times to coat. Add remaining 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter,
		cut into small pieces, and pulse until pea-sized and completely coated
		(about 6 pulses). Transfer cheddar mixture to a medium bowl and set
		aside.

Process 1/2 cup fresh (or frozen, thawed) corn kernals and 3/4 cup buttermilk
		in same processor (no need to clean) until smooth, about 1 minutes. Pour
		into a measuring glass. You should have 1 cup corn mixture; pour in more
		buttermilk to get there if you are short.

Pour into reserve cheddar mixture and mix together with a spatula. Turn
		out onto a generously floured surface and knead until dough comes together
		(it will be crumbly but workable). Shape into a rough rectangle and,
		using a bench scraper, straighten edges.

Cut dough in half; stack 1 half on top of the other. Using your hands
		and a bench scraper, press back into a rectangle. Repeat process 3 times.
		 roll out dough to about a 6x4" rectangle. Transfer to a baking sheet
		and chill at least 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 400*. Cut dough into 8 biscuits. Place on a parchment-lined
		baking sheet, spacing 3" apart. Brush tops with remaining 2 tbsp. Buttermilk,
		then sprinkle with flaky sea salt.

Bake biscuits, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until golden brown,
		25-35 minutes.

Serve warm. 

Do ahead: dough can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and keep chilled.

Flaky Pie Crust	1

0	All-Purpose Flour	2 1/2 Cups	325.00
0	Salt, Kosher	1 Tsp	4.80
0	Butter, Unsalted	6 Tbsp	84.75
0	Vegetable Shortening	2/3 Cup	122.67
0	Water, Ice	1/2 Cup	118.29

Whisk the flour and salt together in a large bowl

Add the butter and shortening. Using a pastry cutter or two forks, cut
		the butter and shortening into the mixture until it resembles coarse
		meal (pea-sized bits with a few larger bits of fat is ok). In this step
		you're only breaking up the cold fat into tiny little flour-coated pieces;
		you're not completely incorporating it. Do not overwork the ingredients

Drizzle ice cold water in, 15 grams (1 tbsp) at a time, and stir with
		a spatula or wooden spoon after every addition. Stop adding water when
		the dough begins to form large clumps. Do not add more water than you
		need (you may need more in winter).

Transfer the pie dough to a floured work surface. Using floured hands,
		fold the dough into itself until the flour is fully incorporated into
		the fats. The dough should come together easily and should not feel overly
		sticky. Avoid overworking the dough. If it feels a bit too dry or crumbly,
		dip your fingers in the ice water and then continue bringing dough together.
		if it feels too sticky, sprinkle on more flour and then continue bringing
		dough together. Form it into a ball. Use a sharp knife to cut it in half.
		you should have around 680 grams of dough (1 lb, 8 oz). Gently flatten
		each half into 1-inch-thick discs.

Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and
		up to 5 days.

After the dough has chilled for at least 2 hours, you can roll it out.
		work with one crust at a time. Lightly flour the work surface, rolling
		pin, and your hands, and sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough.
		use gentle-medium force with your rolling pin on the dough—don’t
		press down too hard on the dough. Start from the center and work your
		way out in all directions, turning the dough with your hands. Between
		passes of the rolling pin, rotate the pie crust and even flip it, to
		make sure it’s not sticking to your work surface. Sprinkle on a little
		more flour if it’s sticking. If you notice the dough becoming a lopsided
		circle, use your hands to help mold the dough back into an even circle.
		roll the dough into a very thin 12-inch circle, which is the perfect
		size to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Your pie dough will be about 1/8 inch
		thick. Visible specks of butter and fat in the dough are perfectly normal.

Use your rolling pin to help transfer the pie crust to the pie dish. Carefully
		roll one end of the circle of dough gently onto the rolling pin, rolling
		it back towards you, slowly peeling it off the work surface as you go.
		pick it up, and carefully roll it back out over the top of the pie dish.

Proceed with the pie per your recipe’s instructions.

Whisk dry yeast, honey, and lukewarm water in a medium bowl and let sit
		5 minutes (it should foam or at least get creamy; if it doesn't your
		yeast is dead and you should start again).

Add all-purpose flour and salt and mix with a spatula until a shaggy
		dough forms and no dry streaks remain.

Pour 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil into a big bowl that will fit in your
		refrigerator. Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat in oil. Cover with
		a silicone lid or plastic wrap and chill until dough is doubled in size
		(it should look very bubbly and alive), at least 8 hours and up to 1
		day. If you're in a rush, you can also let it rise at room temperature
		until doubled in size, 3-4 hours.

Generously butter a 13x9" bakng pan, for thicker focaccia that's perfect
		for sandwiches, or an 18x13" rimmed baking sheet, for focaccia that's
		thinner and crispier. The butter ensures it does not stick to the pan.
		pour 1 tbsp olive-oil into center of pan. Keeping dough in the bowl and
		using a fork in each hand, gather up edges of dough farthest from you
		and lift up and over into the center of the bowl. Give the bowl a quarter
		turn and repeat the process. Do this 2 more times; you want to deflate
		the dough wile you form it into a rough ball. Transfer dough to prepared
		pan. Pour any oil left in bowl over and turn dough to coat in it. Let
		rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm spot until doubled in size, at least
		1 1/2 hours an up to 4 hours.

Preheat oven to 450* with a middle rack set. To see if the dough is ready,
		poke it with a finger; if it springs back quickly and doesn't leave a
		visible indent it is not ready (you can chill ready dough upto 1 hour
		before baking). Lightly oil your hands. If using a rimmed baking sheet,
		gently stretch out dough to fill. Dimple focaccia all over with your
		fingers, like your'e playing the piano, creating deep dimples. Drizzle
		remaining olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake focaccia until
		puffed and golden brown all over, 20-30 minutes.

When ready to serve: melt 4 tbsp (56.5 grams) unsalted butter in a saucepan
		over medium heat. Remove from heatwhile you grate garlic cloves in with
		a microplane. While stirring, return garlic butter to heat until garlic
		begins to brown.

Brush garlic-butter all over focaccia and slice into squares.

Focaccia is best eaten the day it's made, but keeps well in the freezer.
		 slice it, then store the pieces in a freezer-safe container. Reheat
		when ready on a baking sheet in the oven at 300*
