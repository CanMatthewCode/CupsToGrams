Preheat air fryer to 375*. Crumbple a 16x12" piece of parchment paper,
		smooth it out and line a 6x3" springform pan or one with a removable
		bottom. Crease the paper at the edges, pinching it, so it folds over,
		and use your fingers to press the paper down as best you can so it snugly
		hugs the bottom and sides of the pan. 

In a food processor, process the eggs and sugar until smooth, about 30
		seconds. Scut the croom temp cream cheese into pieces and scatter them
		evenly over the sugar and egg mixutre. Pour in the cream and vanilla
		and sprinkle in the flour and salt. Process until smooth and combined,
		another 30 to 40 seconds.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and carefully transfer to the hot
		air fryer basket (use a sling made out of foil to lower and lift the
		baking pan as it might be snug). Bake for about 25 minutes. At the 15-minute
		 mark, check the cake, and if it is already quite dark, cover the cake
		with a larger cake pan that fits over it or with a piece of foil. The
		cake is ready when a thermometer inserted in the center reads about 155*f,
		and the edges are set but the middle still slightly jiggles. Carefully
		transfer the pan to a wire rack and let sit until slightly warm or completely
		cool, about 1 hour. 

Remove the sides of the pan and slide the cake, plus the papered bottom
		of the pan, onto a serving plate. Slice into 8 pieces, dipping the knife
		in hot water and drying between slices. The cake should be tightly wrapped
		when refrigerated once it has completely cooled, but should be brought
		back to room temp to serve.

Pulse 6 oz extra-sharp yellow cheddar, coarsley grated, fine-grind cornmeal,
		sugar, finely chopped sage, baking powder, salt, and all-purpose flour
		in a food processor a couple times to combine.

Add 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, and pulse
		a few times to coat. Add remaining 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter,
		cut into small pieces, and pulse until pea-sized and completely coated
		(about 6 pulses). Transfer cheddar mixture to a medium bowl and set
		aside.

Process 1/2 cup fresh (or frozen, thawed) corn kernals and 3/4 cup buttermilk
		in same processor (no need to clean) until smooth, about 1 minutes. Pour
		into a measuring glass. You should have 1 cup corn mixture; pour in more
		buttermilk to get there if you are short.

Pour into reserve cheddar mixture and mix together with a spatula. Turn
		out onto a generously floured surface and knead until dough comes together
		(it will be crumbly but workable). Shape into a rough rectangle and,
		using a bench scraper, straighten edges.

Cut dough in half; stack 1 half on top of the other. Using your hands
		and a bench scraper, press back into a rectangle. Repeat process 3 times.
		 roll out dough to about a 6x4" rectangle. Transfer to a baking sheet
		and chill at least 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 400*. Cut dough into 8 biscuits. Place on a parchment-lined
		baking sheet, spacing 3" apart. Brush tops with remaining 2 tbsp. Buttermilk,
		then sprinkle with flaky sea salt.

Bake biscuits, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until golden brown,
		25-35 minutes.

Flaky Pie Crust	1

0	Salt, Kosher	1 Tsp	4.80
0	Butter, Unsalted	6 Tbsp	84.75

0	Water, Ice	1/2 Cup	118.29

Whisk the flour and salt together in a large bowl

Add the butter and shortening. Using a pastry cutter or two forks, cut
		the butter and shortening into the mixture until it resembles coarse
		meal (pea-sized bits with a few larger bits of fat is ok). In this step
		you're only breaking up the cold fat into tiny little flour-coated pieces;
		you're not completely incorporating it. Do not overwork the ingredients

Drizzle ice cold water in, 15 grams (1 tbsp) at a time, and stir with
		a spatula or wooden spoon after every addition. Stop adding water when
		the dough begins to form large clumps. Do not add more water than you
		need (you may need more in winter).

Transfer the pie dough to a floured work surface. Using floured hands,
		fold the dough into itself until the flour is fully incorporated into
		the fats. The dough should come together easily and should not feel overly
		sticky. Avoid overworking the dough. If it feels a bit too dry or crumbly,
		dip your fingers in the ice water and then continue bringing dough together.
		if it feels too sticky, sprinkle on more flour and then continue bringing
		dough together. Form it into a ball. Use a sharp knife to cut it in half.
		you should have around 680 grams of dough (1 lb, 8 oz). Gently flatten
		each half into 1-inch-thick discs.

Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and
		up to 5 days.

After the dough has chilled for at least 2 hours, you can roll it out.
		work with one crust at a time. Lightly flour the work surface, rolling
		pin, and your hands, and sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough.
		use gentle-medium force with your rolling pin on the dough—don’t
		press down too hard on the dough. Start from the center and work your
		way out in all directions, turning the dough with your hands. Between
		passes of the rolling pin, rotate the pie crust and even flip it, to
		make sure it’s not sticking to your work surface. Sprinkle on a little
		more flour if it’s sticking. If you notice the dough becoming a lopsided
		circle, use your hands to help mold the dough back into an even circle.
		roll the dough into a very thin 12-inch circle, which is the perfect
		size to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Your pie dough will be about 1/8 inch
		thick. Visible specks of butter and fat in the dough are perfectly normal.

Use your rolling pin to help transfer the pie crust to the pie dish. Carefully
		roll one end of the circle of dough gently onto the rolling pin, rolling
		it back towards you, slowly peeling it off the work surface as you go.
		pick it up, and carefully roll it back out over the top of the pie dish.

Proceed with the pie per your recipe’s instructions.

Whisk dry yeast, honey, and lukewarm water in a medium bowl and let sit
		5 minutes (it should foam or at least get creamy; if it doesn't your
		yeast is dead and you should start again).

Add all-purpose flour and salt and mix with a spatula until a shaggy
		dough forms and no dry streaks remain.

Pour 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil into a big bowl that will fit in your
		refrigerator. Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat in oil. Cover with
		a silicone lid or plastic wrap and chill until dough is doubled in size
		(it should look very bubbly and alive), at least 8 hours and up to 1
		day. If you're in a rush, you can also let it rise at room temperature
		until doubled in size, 3-4 hours.

Generously butter a 13x9" bakng pan, for thicker focaccia that's perfect
		for sandwiches, or an 18x13" rimmed baking sheet, for focaccia that's
		thinner and crispier. The butter ensures it does not stick to the pan.
		pour 1 tbsp olive-oil into center of pan. Keeping dough in the bowl and
		using a fork in each hand, gather up edges of dough farthest from you
		and lift up and over into the center of the bowl. Give the bowl a quarter
		turn and repeat the process. Do this 2 more times; you want to deflate
		the dough wile you form it into a rough ball. Transfer dough to prepared
		pan. Pour any oil left in bowl over and turn dough to coat in it. Let
		rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm spot until doubled in size, at least
		1 1/2 hours an up to 4 hours.

Preheat oven to 450* with a middle rack set. To see if the dough is ready,
		poke it with a finger; if it springs back quickly and doesn't leave a
		visible indent it is not ready (you can chill ready dough upto 1 hour
		before baking). Lightly oil your hands. If using a rimmed baking sheet,
		gently stretch out dough to fill. Dimple focaccia all over with your
		fingers, like your'e playing the piano, creating deep dimples. Drizzle
		remaining olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake focaccia until
		puffed and golden brown all over, 20-30 minutes.

When ready to serve: melt 4 tbsp (56.5 grams) unsalted butter in a saucepan
		over medium heat. Remove from heatwhile you grate garlic cloves in with
		a microplane. While stirring, return garlic butter to heat until garlic
		begins to brown.

Brush garlic-butter all over focaccia and slice into squares.

Focaccia is best eaten the day it's made, but keeps well in the freezer.
		 slice it, then store the pieces in a freezer-safe container. Reheat
		when ready on a baking sheet in the oven at 300*

Peel the peaches then cut into 1-2 inch chunks until you have 7 cups.
		In a large bowl, stir the peach chunks, brown sugar, flour, lemon juice,
		and cinnamon together until thoroughly combined. Set filling aside as
		the oven preheats.

Preheat oven to 400*f (~200*c).

On a floured surface, roll out your crust until you have a 12 inch diameter
		circle. Place the dough in a 9" pie pan, using your fingers to smooth
		the sides down. Using a slatted spoon, dish peach filling into the crust,
		leaving the liquid behind. Use a pairing knife to trim the crust edges,
		then crimp or flute them down.

In a medium bowl, combine the second servings of brown sugar, cinnamon,
		and flour. Stir in the melted and slightly cooled butter. The topping
		should be thick and crumbly. Sprinkle over peaches.

Place the pie onto a large baking sheet in the middle of the oven and
		bake for 20 minutes. Kafter 20 minutes, rotate pie, place pie crust shield
		on the top to prevent the edges from burning, and turn the oven temperature
		down to 375*f (190*c). Bake for another 30-35 minutes or until the peach
		juices are bubbling on the sides and the top is lightly browned. 

Allow the pie to cool for 3 hours at room temp to fully set before cutting.
		You can place in refrigerator to quicken this as well. 

Serve with vanilla ice cream. Covered pie can store up to 5 days in fridge.
