Preheat air fryer to 375*F. Crumble a 16x12" piece of parchment paper,
		smooth it out and line a 6x3" springform pan or one with a removable
		bottom. Crease the paper at the edges so it folds over, and use your
		fingers to press the paper down so it snugly hugs the bottom and sides
		of the pan.

In a food processor, process the eggs and sugar until smooth, about 30
		seconds. Scatter the cream cheese pieces evenly over the sugar and egg
		mixture. Pour in the cream and vanilla, and sprinkle in the flour and
		salt. Process until smooth and combined, another 30 to 40 seconds.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and carefully transfer to the hot
		air fryer basket (use a sling made out of foil to lower and lift the
		baking pan as it might be snug). Bake for about 25 minutes. At the 15-minute
		mark, check the cake, and if it is already quite dark, cover the cake
		with a larger cake pan that fits over it or with a piece of foil. The
		cake is ready when a thermometer inserted in the center reads about 155*F
		and the edges are set but the middle still slightly jiggles. Carefully
		transfer the pan to a wire rack and let sit until slightly warm or completely
		cool, about 1 hour.

Remove the sides of the pan and slide the cake, plus the papered bottom
		of the pan, onto a serving plate. Slice into 8 pieces, dipping the knife
		in hot water and drying between slices. The cake should be tightly wrapped
		when refrigerated once it has completely cooled, but should be brought
		back to room temp to serve.

Use full fat cream cheese, cut into 1" pieces and softened.

Heavy cream should be at room temperature before use.

Pulse 6 oz extra-sharp yellow cheddar, coarsley grated, fine-grind cornmeal,
		sugar, finely chopped sage, baking powder, salt, and all-purpose flour
		in a food processor a couple times to combine.

Add 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, and pulse
		a few times to coat. Add remaining 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter,
		cut into small pieces, and pulse until pea-sized and completely coated
		(about 6 pulses). Transfer cheddar mixture to a medium bowl and set
		aside.

Process 1/2 cup fresh (or frozen, thawed) corn kernals and 3/4 cup buttermilk
		in same processor (no need to clean) until smooth, about 1 minutes. Pour
		into a measuring glass. You should have 1 cup corn mixture; pour in more
		buttermilk to get there if you are short.

Pour into reserve cheddar mixture and mix together with a spatula. Turn
		out onto a generously floured surface and knead until dough comes together
		(it will be crumbly but workable). Shape into a rough rectangle and,
		using a bench scraper, straighten edges.

Cut dough in half; stack 1 half on top of the other. Using your hands
		and a bench scraper, press back into a rectangle. Repeat process 3 times.
		Roll out dough to about a 6x4" rectangle. Transfer to a baking sheet
		and chill at least 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 400*F. Cut dough into 8 biscuits. Place on a parchment-lined
		baking sheet, spacing 3" apart. Brush tops with remaining 2 tbsp buttermilk,
		then sprinkle with flaky sea salt.

Bake biscuits, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until golden brown,
		25-35 minutes.

Peel potatoes and cut into quarters, sixths, or eights, depending on size.

Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°f (230°c)
		(or 400°f (200°c) if using convection). Heat 2 quarts (2l) water in
		a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add kosher salt, baking soda,
		and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook
		until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk,
		about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.

Meanwhile, combine olive oil (or duck / beef fat) with rosemary, garlic,
		and a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium
		heat. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins
		to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh
		strainer set in a large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve
		separately.

When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot
		for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer
		to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and
		pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of
		mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.

Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading
		them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes.
		Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake
		pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown
		and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking,
		30 to 40 minutes longer.

Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and
		minced parsley. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to
		taste. Serve immediately.

Yukon gold potatoes work best but russet are fine too. 

Leave the potatoes in large chunks, a full quarter of a potato each unless
		they are very large.

Don't try to flip the potatoes too soon or the bottoms may rip off. Use
		a very thin spatula to get underneith before flipping.

Flaky Pie Crust	1
5
0	All-Purpose Flour	2 1/2 Cups	325.00
0	Salt, Kosher	1 Tsp	4.80
0	Butter, Unsalted	6 Tbsp	84.75
0	Vegetable Shortening	2/3 Cup	122.67
0	Water, Ice	1/2 Cup	118.29
8
Whisk the flour and salt together in a large bowl

Add the butter and shortening. Using a pastry cutter or two forks, cut
		the butter and shortening into the mixture until it resembles coarse
		meal (pea-sized bits with a few larger bits of fat is ok). In this step
		you're only breaking up the cold fat into tiny little flour-coated pieces;
		you're not completely incorporating it. Do not overwork the ingredients

Drizzle ice cold water in, 15 grams (1 tbsp) at a time, and stir with
		a spatula or wooden spoon after every addition. Stop adding water when
		the dough begins to form large clumps. Do not add more water than you
		need (you may need more in winter).

Transfer the pie dough to a floured work surface. Using floured hands,
		fold the dough into itself until the flour is fully incorporated into
		the fats. The dough should come together easily and should not feel overly
		sticky. Avoid overworking the dough. If it feels a bit too dry or crumbly,
		dip your fingers in the ice water and then continue bringing dough together.
		if it feels too sticky, sprinkle on more flour and then continue bringing
		dough together. Form it into a ball. Use a sharp knife to cut it in half.
		you should have around 680 grams of dough (1 lb, 8 oz). Gently flatten
		each half into 1-inch-thick discs.

Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and
		up to 5 days.

After the dough has chilled for at least 2 hours, you can roll it out.
		work with one crust at a time. Lightly flour the work surface, rolling
		pin, and your hands, and sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough.
		use gentle-medium force with your rolling pin on the dough—don’t
		press down too hard on the dough. Start from the center and work your
		way out in all directions, turning the dough with your hands. Between
		passes of the rolling pin, rotate the pie crust and even flip it, to
		make sure it’s not sticking to your work surface. Sprinkle on a little
		more flour if it’s sticking. If you notice the dough becoming a lopsided
		circle, use your hands to help mold the dough back into an even circle.
		roll the dough into a very thin 12-inch circle, which is the perfect
		size to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Your pie dough will be about 1/8 inch
		thick. Visible specks of butter and fat in the dough are perfectly normal.

Use your rolling pin to help transfer the pie crust to the pie dish. Carefully
		roll one end of the circle of dough gently onto the rolling pin, rolling
		it back towards you, slowly peeling it off the work surface as you go.
		pick it up, and carefully roll it back out over the top of the pie dish.

Proceed with the pie per your recipe’s instructions.

Preheat your oven to 350*F (177*C) with one rack in the center and one
		on the lowest rung. Grease an 8-inch round cake pan, line with parchment
		paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps
		the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. The cake will stick unless
		it’s lined and greased. Heat a kettle of water.

Cut the butter into pieces so it melts evenly. Place in a large heat-proof
		bowl. Add chopped chocolate. Melt in 20 second increments in the microwave,
		stirring after each increment until completely melted and smooth. Let
		cool for 2-3 minutes. Or use a double boiler if desired.

Whisk the sugar, first espresso powder, and vanilla extract into the chocolate
		mixture. Whisk in the eggs until smooth. The mixture will be heavy and
		tacky, like brownie batter. Whisk in the cocoa powder, salt, and baking
		powder (if using).

Pour and spread batter into prepared cake pan.

Place a large metal roasting pan or baking dish on the bottom oven rack.
		Do not use glass. Pour boiling water from kettle about 2 inches up the
		sides of the pan. Quickly place the cake on the center rack and shut
		the oven door, trapping steam inside. The steam helps moisten the cake.

Bake for 30 minutes until the edges are set. The cake is done when a toothpick
		inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean or with just a few
		crumbs. It’s important to not over-bake this cake, which dries it out.
		Begin checking it at 25 minutes. Don’t be alarmed if the cake rises
		tall around the edges and slightly cracks—this is normal (it’s the
		eggs expanding) and will flatten as it cools.

Remove from the oven, place cake on a cooling rack, and cool for only
		10 minutes in the cake pan. Run a sharp knife around the edges to help
		release the warm cake, then quickly invert it onto a serving plate or
		cake stand. (if it cools completely in the pan, it’s very difficult
		to release from the pan.) cake will be a little crumbly on the edges.
		Cool completely at room temp, or in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours.

Once the cake is cool, top with of raspberries and mocha whipped cream
		(or flavors of your choice).

Using a fork, mix the last tsp espresso powder and your warm water in
		a very small bowl, then let cool a few minutes. Using a hand or stand
		mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream, sugar, cocoa
		powder, and espresso mixture on medium-high speed until medium peaks
		form, about 3-4 minutes. Medium peaks are between soft/loose peaks and
		stiff peaks and are the perfect consistency for topping and piping on
		desserts. Serve cake with whipped cream or pipe it on top. Decorate with
		raspberries and a dusting of confectioners’ sugar, if desired.

Cover and store leftover cake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Whisk dry yeast, honey, and lukewarm water in a medium bowl and let sit
		5 minutes (it should foam or at least get creamy; if it doesn't your
		yeast is dead and you should start again).

Add all-purpose flour and salt and mix with a spatula until a shaggy
		dough forms and no dry streaks remain.

Pour 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil into a big bowl that will fit in your
		refrigerator. Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat in oil. Cover with
		a silicone lid or plastic wrap and chill until dough is doubled in size
		(it should look very bubbly and alive), at least 8 hours and up to 1
		day. If you're in a rush, you can also let it rise at room temperature
		until doubled in size, 3-4 hours.

Generously butter a 13x9" bakng pan, for thicker focaccia that's perfect
		for sandwiches, or an 18x13" rimmed baking sheet, for focaccia that's
		thinner and crispier. The butter ensures it does not stick to the pan.
		pour 1 tbsp olive-oil into center of pan. Keeping dough in the bowl and
		using a fork in each hand, gather up edges of dough farthest from you
		and lift up and over into the center of the bowl. Give the bowl a quarter
		turn and repeat the process. Do this 2 more times; you want to deflate
		the dough wile you form it into a rough ball. Transfer dough to prepared
		pan. Pour any oil left in bowl over and turn dough to coat in it. Let
		rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm spot until doubled in size, at least
		1 1/2 hours an up to 4 hours.

Preheat oven to 450*F with a middle rack set. To see if the dough is ready,
		poke it with a finger; if it springs back quickly and doesn't leave a
		visible indent it is not ready (you can chill ready dough upto 1 hour
		before baking). Lightly oil your hands. If using a rimmed baking sheet,
		gently stretch out dough to fill. Dimple focaccia all over with your
		fingers, like your'e playing the piano, creating deep dimples. Drizzle
		remaining olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake focaccia until
		puffed and golden brown all over, 20-30 minutes.

When ready to serve: melt 4 tbsp (56.5 grams) unsalted butter in a saucepan
		over medium heat. Remove from heatwhile you grate garlic cloves in with
		a microplane. While stirring, return garlic butter to heat until garlic
		begins to brown.

Brush garlic-butter all over focaccia and slice into squares.

Focaccia is best eaten the day it's made, but keeps well in the freezer.

Peel the peaches then cut into 1-2 inch chunks until you have 7 cups.
		In a large bowl, stir the peach chunks, brown sugar, flour, lemon juice,
		and cinnamon together until thoroughly combined. Set filling aside as
		the oven preheats.

Preheat oven to 400*F (~200*C).

On a floured surface, roll out your crust until you have a 12 inch diameter
		circle. Place the dough in a 9" pie pan, using your fingers to smooth
		the sides down. Using a slatted spoon, dish peach filling into the crust,
		leaving the liquid behind. Use a pairing knife to trim the crust edges,
		then crimp or flute them down.

In a medium bowl, combine the second servings of brown sugar, cinnamon,
		and flour. Stir in the melted and slightly cooled butter. The topping
		should be thick and crumbly. Sprinkle over peaches.

Place the pie onto a large baking sheet in the middle of the oven and
		bake for 20 minutes. Kafter 20 minutes, rotate pie, place pie crust shield
		on the top to prevent the edges from burning, and turn the oven temperature
		down to 375*F (190*C). Bake for another 30-35 minutes or until the peach
		juices are bubbling on the sides and the top is lightly browned.

Allow the pie to cool for 3 hours at room temp to fully set before cutting.
		You can place in refrigerator to quicken this as well. 

Serve with vanilla ice cream. Covered pie can store up to 5 days in fridge.

Equipment needed: cuisinart with shredding disc, 2 large bowls (one deep),
		one small bowl, large dish towels you don't mind staining, large cast-iron
		skillet, lots of paper towels, a fine mesh skimmer.

Peel the potatoes and store in the large bowl in water. Peel the onions.
		Put a dish towel in the bottom of the 2nd bowl.

Cut the potatoes into small enough slices they fit through the food processor's
		opening. Shred potatoes. When the container is full, put the contents
		into the bowl with the towel. Do this for two containers of potatoes.

Repeat the process with the onions, but drain the liquid before adding
		to the bowl. 

Remove as much liquid as possible from the potato mixture. To do this
		either: a) wrap the dish towel into a bag around the mixture, pulling
		up the corners and tying them in a knot. Holding the bag over the smaller
		bowl, twist the gathered ends of the towel tightly against the bundle,
		squeezing it tightly. You can insert a wooden spoon below the knot and
		use it to twist farther. Or: b) using your hands or a dish towel, press
		down hard on the top of the mixture, until liquid rises to the surface.
		Pour the liquid into the third, smaller bowl, using the dish towel or
		your hands to prevent the potatoes from falling out. Push the mixture
		to one side of the bowl to expose part of the bottom, and repeat until
		no further liquid can be extracted. Do not discard the liquid.

Pour 1" or more of oil into the cast-iron skillet, and heat over medium
		heat while you prepare the batter. Turn the oven to 200*F.

To the potato mixture add 2 eggs, the matzo meal, salt, and pepper. Mix
		thoroughly. In the meantime, the potato liquid will have settled, leaving
		clear water over a bed of potato starch. Carefully drain the water and
		reserve the starch. The batter should be somewhat wet, and a latke firmly
		formed in your hand should hold together without breaking apart. Add
		potato starch if needed. If the mixture is too dry, add another egg and
		adjust starch as necessary.

Make a test latke. Prepare a plate with paper towels. Check the oil by
		adding a single shred of potato -- it should bubble vigorously and audibly.
		Using a slotted spoon, press about 1/4 cup of batter into a firm puck,
		letting any liquid drain back into the potato mixture. If it's too oblong,
		reshape gently. Slide it carefully into the oil. Cook until the bottom
		of the latke is golden brown with only a little yellow remaining, about
		1 minute, then carefully turn. After another 60-90 seconds, when both
		surfaces are cooked but the edges are not charred, remove and drain on
		paper towels. Cut latke in half and inspect the interior -- it should
		be a little wet in the center still, but not raw. This latke will be
		a little unbalanced since it's the only one in the pan. 

Adjust the batter as follows: a) very crispy outside, raw in center: add
		egg. It will conduct the heat into the interior of the latke. B) fell
		apart in oil: too wet? Add starch/matzo meal. Too dry? Add egg (and starch/matzo
		meal). C) don't be afraid to add more salt/pepper! Season liberally.

Cook several latkes at once, leaving yourself room to turn. Constantly
		remove any extra shreds of potato floating around! They bring down the
		temperature of the oil. The skimmer comes in really useful here. As latkes
		are done, after a few minutes of draining, add them in layers to a sheet
		pan in the oven. Any remaining rawness will cook off here.

Repeat steps 2-8 with every batch, including the test latke. In between
		batches, carefully remove as much crud from the oil as you can. If the
		oil becomes too dirty, add additional oil, or if you don't have more
		room in the pan, replace 2/3 with fresh oil. Be sure to let it come back
		up to temperature.

Do two days ahead:

Combine the bread flour, salt, sugar, yeast, water, egg whites, buttter,
		and cream in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix until just combined,
		about 3 minutes. When finished the dough will be rough and have very
		little gluten development.

Lightly grease a medium bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Transfer the
		dough to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly on the surface
		of the dough to prevent a skin from forming. Proof the dough in a warm
		spot until doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours.

Remove the plastic wrap and punch down the dough by folding the edges
		into the center, releasing as much of the gas as possible. On a piece
		of parchment paper, shape into a 10" (35 cm) square. Transfer to a sheet
		pan, still on the parchment paper, and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate
		overnight.

Butter block: draw a 7-inch (18 cm) square on a piece of parchment paper
		with a pencil. Flip the parchment over so the butter won't contact the
		pencil marks. Place the butter in the center of the square and spread
		evenly with an offset spatula to fill the squre. Refrigerate overnight.

Prepare your favorite ganache recipe and refrigerate.

Do one day ahead:

Laminate: remove the dough from the refrigerator making sure it is very
		cold throughout. Place the dough on a floured surface and using a rolling
		pin, roll the dough to your 10" (35 cm) square which is about 1" (2.5
		cm) thick. Arrange the butter block in the center of the dough so it
		looks like a diamond in the center of the square (rotated 45 degrees
		with the corners of the butter block facing the edges of the dough).
		Pull the corners of the dough up over the center of the butter block.
		Pinch the seams of dough together to seal the butter inside. You should
		have a square slightly larger than the butter block.

Very lightly dust your work surface with flour. Roll out the dough from
		the center with a firm, steady hand. When finished you should have a
		20" (50 cm) square about 1/4" (6 mm) thick. 

Fld the dough in half horizontally, making sure to line up the edges so
		you are left with a rectangle. Then fold the dough vertically. You hsould
		have a 10" (25.5 cm) square of dough with 4 layers. Wrap tightly in plastic
		and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Repeat the above two steps. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate
		overnight.

Do day of:

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough to a 15" (40 cm) square about
		1/2" (1.3 cm) thick. Transfer dough to a half sheet pan, cover with plastic
		wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour to relax.

Using a 3 1/2" (9 cm) ring cutter, cut 12 roungds. Cut out the center
		of each round with a 1" (2.5 cm) ring cutter to create the doughnut shape.

Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and lightly dust the parchment with
		flour. Place the pastries on the pan, spacing them about 3" (8 cm) apart.
		Lightly spray a piece of plastic wrap with nonstick spray and lay it
		on top of the pastries. Proof in a warm spot until tripple in size, about
		2 hours. 

Fry dough: heat grapeseed oil in a large pot until it reaches 350*F (175*C).
		Use a deep-frying thermometer to verify that the oil is at the right
		temperature. Line a platter with several layers of paper towels for draining
		the pastries. 

Gently place 3 or 4 of them at a time into the hot oil. Fry for about
		90 seconds on each side , flipping once, until golden brown. Remove from
		the oil with a slotted spoon and drian on the paper towels.

Check that the oil is at the right temperature. If not, let it heat up
		again before frying the next batch. Continue until all of them are fried.
		Let cool completely before filling.
